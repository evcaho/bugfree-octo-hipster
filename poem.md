#Coming

##On longer evenings,##
###Light, chill and yellow,###
####Bathes the serene####
#####Foreheads of houses.#####
A thrush sings,
Laurel-surrounded
In the deep bare garden,
Its fresh-peeled voice
_Astonishing_ the brickwork.
It will be spring soon,
It will be spring soon --
And I, whose childhood
Is a forgotten boredom,
Feel like a child
Who comes on a scene
Of adult reconciling,
And can understand nothing
But the unusual laughter,
And starts to be happy.
